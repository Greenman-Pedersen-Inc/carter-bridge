                            The Carter Bridge/Brooks Street Interchange Project, funded by the West Virginia
                            Division of Highways, is a bridge painting and repair project of fifteen (15)
                            bridges on the I-77/I-64 corridor in Charleston, WV. The project footprint
                            includes the bridges associated with the I-77/I-64 interchange (Bigley Ave.
                            bridges/ramps) on the north side of downtown Charleston and stretches east across
                            the Elk River and Kanawha Valley Railroad to the I-77/I-64 ramps for Leon Sullivan
                            Way and Brooks Street.

                            The project was let on the February 8th, 2022, WVDOH Project Letting for a price
                            of $27,420,996.50 to Blastech Enterprises, Inc. from Baltimore, MD. The project

                            The original bridges were built in the early 1970’s and are due for maintenance to
                            keep them functioning properly, extending their useful lifespan for years to come.
                            In addition to cleaning and painting the structural steel of the fifteen (15)
                            bridges, the project will make various improvements to the existing bridges that
                            include: concrete crack and spall repairs, concrete protective coating, bolt
                            replacements, repair and cleaning of bridge drainage, bridge joint cleaning,
                            access door repairs, parapet plate armoring, fence replacement, electrical and
                            lighting repairs, and erosion repairs. The existing pedestrian bridge over
                            I-77/I-64 and staircases will be removed as part of the project.

                            With the majority of the project work to be performed underneath the bridges, the
                            traveling public should expect various roadway closures and detours to local
                            streets as well as partial closures to parking lots under the bridges associated
                            with the project. Additionally, nightly lane closures and various ramp closures
                            along the I-77/I-64 corridor will occur within the project limits.
